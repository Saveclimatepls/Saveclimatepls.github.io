    <!--Three easy steps that everyone can start now!-->
    <h2>1) 🌍First easy peasy step you can help is by using reusable shopping bags instead of plastic bags and refill instead of buying a new one! In my house, we always buy refill for hand soap and water purifier instead of buying plastic bottles. It feels so nice and healthy knowing that your water has nothing added to it!</h2>
     
    <h2>2) 🌍Unplug wifi when not in-use. Trust me, it will not disconnect you. My family always do this when we are out on vacation or just during school days when no one is home.</h2>
      
    <h2>3) 🌍Hang your clothes outside in the sun on hot sunny days! It does not only save energy but also leave your clothes with better scent than using dryer! Thai people always do this, we don’t have dryer in Thailand.</h2>
